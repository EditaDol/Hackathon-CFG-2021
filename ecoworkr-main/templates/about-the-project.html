  <h2>About the project</h2>
  
  <div class='half'>

  <p>ecoworkr is our project for the <a href="https://codefirstgirls.org.uk/"><u>Code First Girls</u></a> and
  <a href="https://www.beazley.com/london_market.html"><u>Beazley</u></a> 2021 Hackathon “Hack Your Carbon Footprint”, which challenged us to
  create a product, app, or website that will empower employers, employees, and freelancers to slash their carbon footprint. We created
  this website off the fact that the way we work has rapidly changed and will only continue to do so. Remote and hybrid working is
  becoming the norm. Companies are embracing this due to the benefits that workplace flexibility has on team productivity and attracting
  talent. The world saw a massive decrease in global carbon emissions when lockdowns forced us all to stay home, with no commute to the
  office and no overseas travelling. Flexible working can help keep these emissions down. However, with tech being an integral part of
  most of our everyday lives, our attention must now turn to our digital carbon footprint. ecoworkr empowers individuals and companies
  alike to become more aware of the environmental impact that the online tools we use everyday have on the world we live in. We think
  this knowledge should be free and accessible to all. So, while we are currently a work in progress, ecoworkr will forever
  remain an accessible tool for all. If you'd like to reach out for more information, you can reach us on LinkedIn, or use the contact
  form below.</p>
